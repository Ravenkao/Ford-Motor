## Ford LiDAR Sensor Cost-Benefit Analysis

Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to conduct a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of different LiDAR sensor types (Mechanical, Solid-State, and Hybrid) to determine their suitability for various applications, including autonomous vehicles, drones, and industrial automation. The analysis considers key metrics such as cost, durability, performance, and applicability.

### Key Metrics

	1.	Initial Cost: The cost range for each sensor type, including budget-friendliness.
	2.	Durability: Resistance to wear and tear, particularly for sensors with or without moving parts.
	3.	Performance:
	•	Resolution: Clarity of captured environmental data.
	•	Scanning Speed: Ability to function in fast-moving scenarios.
	4.	Power Consumption: Energy efficiency of the sensors.
	5.	Applications: Practical use cases based on the sensor’s features and limitations.

### Key Findings

Results from Cost-Benefit Analysis

	1.	Mechanical LiDAR:
	•	Strengths: Low cost, suitable for large-scale mapping and static environments.
	•	Weaknesses: Moderate durability and slow scanning speed make it less ideal for dynamic scenarios.
	•	Score: Moderate.
	2.	Solid-State LiDAR:
	•	Strengths: High durability and scanning speed, energy-efficient, best for fast-moving and dynamic applications.
	•	Weaknesses: High initial cost and best suited for short-range sensing.
	•	Score: High.
	3.	Hybrid LiDAR:
	•	Strengths: Balanced performance in terms of resolution, scanning speed, and range at a mid-level cost.
	•	Weaknesses: Less specialized than other types but suitable for diverse applications.
	•	Score: Mid-high.

 ### Conclusions

Recommendation: For dynamic, fast-paced environments, Solid-State LiDAR is the most reliable choice despite its cost. For budget-conscious projects requiring static mapping, Mechanical LiDAR is optimal. 
Hybrid LiDAR is ideal for mid-range budgets and diverse applications that demand both range and performance balance.

Future Considerations: More advanced analysis could incorporate dynamic pricing, additional performance factors, and real-world testing data to enhance decision-making.
